This project tackles the classic "Dogs vs. Cats" image classification problem using a machine learning approach. It leverages Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction and a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, achieving a notable accuracy in distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.
